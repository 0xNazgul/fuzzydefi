# Fuzzy DeFi

## Properties
This repository contains code properties for the current top five forked protocols:
1. [Uniswap v2](/protocols/uniswap-v2/README.md) An AMM powered by the constant product formula, [properties](/PROPERTIES.md#L15).
2. [Olympus DAO](/protocols/olympus-v1/README.md) A protocol-owned Treasury serving the market gap between stablecoins and volatile assets, [properties](/PROPERTIES.md#L36).
3. [Compound v2](/protocols/compound-v2/README.md#L46) An algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol, [properties](/PROPERTIES.md#L).
4. [Tomb Finance](/protocols/tombfinance/README.md) An algorithmic token pegged to `FTM`, [properties](/PROPERTIES.md#L60).

The goals of these properties are to:
* Detect vulnerabilities
* Ensure adherence to the original protocols properties
* Provide educational guidance for writing invariants

## Testing
1. Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
